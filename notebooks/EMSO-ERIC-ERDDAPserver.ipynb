      "The European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water column Observatory (EMSO) is a research infrastructure distributed throughout Europe for seabed and water column observatories. It aims to further explore the oceans, better understand the phenomena that occur on the seabed, and elucidate the critical role that these phenomena play in global Earth systems. This observatory is based on observation sites (or nodes) that have been deployed in strategic locations in European seas, from the Arctic to the Atlantic, from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. There are currently eleven deep water nodes plus four shallow water test nodes. EMSO Western Ligurian is one of these permanent underwater observatories located in the Ligurian Sea and is deployed off Toulon, France. This region was chosen for its particular scientific interests such as: seismicity, topography, turbidity, biodiversity, water mass dynamics and organic matter flow. This underwater observation network is also part of KM3NeT (https://www.km3net.org/) which has a modular topology designed to connect up to 120 neutrino detection units. Earth and Sea Science (ESS) instrumentation connected to KM3NeT is based on two complementary components: an instrumented interface module (MII) and an autonomous instrumented line (ALBATROSS). The ALBATROSS line is an inductive line (2000 m) composed of an acoustic communication system, two inductive cables equipped with Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD)-O2 sensors, current meters and two instrumented buoys. This line is deployed at a distance of 2-3 kilometers from the MII, and communication on land is done by an acoustic link with the MII, and electro-optical cable via the KM3NeT node.\n",

This underwater observation network is also part of KM3NeT (https://www.km3net.org/) which has a modular topology designed to connect up to 120 neutrino detection units. Earth and Sea Science (ESS) instrumentation connected to KM3NeT is based on two complementary components: an instrumented interface module (MII) and an autonomous instrumented line (ALBATROSS). The ALBATROSS line is an inductive line (2000 m) composed of an acoustic communication system, two inductive cables equipped with Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD)-O2 sensors, current meters and two instrumented buoys. This line is deployed at a distance of 2-3 kilometers from the MII, and communication on land is done by an acoustic link with the MII, and electro-optical cable via the KM3NeT node.\n",
      "The European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water column Observatory (EMSO) is a research infrastructure distributed throughout Europe for seabed and water column observatories. It aims to further explore the oceans, better understand the phenomena that occur on the seabed, and elucidate the critical role that these phenomena play in global Earth systems. This observatory is based on observation sites (or nodes) that have been deployed in strategic locations in European seas, from the Arctic to the Atlantic, from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. There are currently eleven deep water nodes plus four shallow water test nodes.

The SmartBay Observatory is an important contribution by Ireland to the growing global network of real-time data capture systems deployed in the ocean. Data relating to the marine environment at the SmartBay Observatory site is transferred in real-time through a fibre optic telecommunications cable to the Marine Institute headquarters and then made publically available on the internet. The data includes a live video stream, the depth of the observatory node, the water temperature and salinity, and estimates of the chlorophyll and turbidity levels in the water which give an indication of the volume of phytoplankton and other particles, such as sediment, in the water. Maintenance take place on the observatory every 18 to 24 months. This CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) and Oxygen Dataset comprises of the raw data that is collected from the Galway Observatory site using a SeaBird 16plus Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) sensor probe. The sensor measures the temperature and conductivity of the seawater. The conductivity is used to calculate an estimate of the salinity. The pressure exerted by the seawater above is used to calculate the depth of the sensor, and these parameters are also used to estimate the speed of sound within the sea. The SBE16plus CTD has also been equipped with a SBE43 dissolved oxygen sensor which measures the dissolved oxygen concentration of the seawater. The sensor is deployed on the EMSO Smartbay Cable End Equipment Node in Galway Bay in approx. 25m depth of water.\n",
      "The SmartBay Observatory in Galway Bay is an underwater observatory which uses cameras, probes and sensors to permit continuous and remote live underwater monitoring. The observatory was installed in 2015 on the seafloor 1.5km off the coast of Spiddal, Co. Galway, Ireland at a depth of 20-25m. Underwater observatories allow ocean researchers unique real-time access to monitor ongoing changes in the marine environment.

Maintenance take place on the observatory every 18 to 24 months. A WetLabs ECO-FLNTU is installed on the observatory infrastructure. It measures the fluorescence of the seawater to give an estimate of the volume of chlorophyll present (indicative of the amount of phytoplankton in the seawater) and it measures turbidity, or the 'cloudiness' of the seawater, caused by the presence of particles such as sediment from the seabed suspended in the water. The sensor is deployed on the EMSO Smartbay Cable End Equipment Node in Galway Bay in approx. 25m depth of water.\n",

      "This dataset contains data from a single array mooring covering the depths between 500 m and 2000 m (bottom) at Station M (OWSM) in the Norwegian Seas located at 66 N, 2 E. Measurements frequency is 1/1 hr for the hydrography (temperature, salinity, pressure) and 1/12 hr for the carbon measurements.At 800 m and 1200 m nominal depth, the pressure has been calculated based on distance between the SBE sensors. The CO2 sensor data (at 500 m nominal depth) are validated by comparing the values towards calculated pCO2 from discrete Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and Total Alkalinity (TA) taken multiple times a year. Calibrated values are available. Data from 2020 onwards are part of the NorEMSO project. The NorEMSO data is part of EMSO-ERIC.\n",
